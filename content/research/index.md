New Preprint:
[Curvature Filtrations for Graph Generative Model Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.12906)

At the moment, I am interested in understanding applications of different curvature measures on finite, undirected graphs. The hope is to bring ideas from differential geometry and computational topology and adapt them to discrete structures (e.g. graphs) and use them to bolster graph topics in graph learning. In this first work, we target graph generative modeling workflows by providing a more expressive, foundational comparison method for distributions of graphs. This could have serious implications in a number of fields including molecular generation and drug development. I am also interested in pioneering new curvature + TDA methods for research questions in environmental science (particularily climate change) and medicine.


I will try to keep this page updated to reflect what projects I am thinking about/working on at the moment. If you'd like to chat or have ideas for a collaboration, please send me an email!
<!-- Broadly speaking, I am interested in the interface between mathematics and data science. This began as an undergraduate where I started to notice profound connections between my coursework in pure mathematics and my research in observational and theoretical astrophysics. Investigations and reading courses on topics in category theory, topology, and machine learning during my Master's (shoutout [Drew Moshier](https://www.chapman.edu/engineering/about/faculty/program-faculty/drew-moshier.aspx) and [Alex Kurz](https://alexhkurz.github.io/)) made this niche even more compelling. Inevitably, I found topological data analysis (TDA), computational topology, and many other fascinating topics in this area and decided to make this the focus of my doctoral studies. -->
