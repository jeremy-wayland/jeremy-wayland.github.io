  title: "More about me!"
  content: "I'm born and raised in California ‚òÄÔ∏è I love to surf, ski,
  snowboard and and generally enjoy the outdoors. 
  Now that I live in Munich, I've
  transitioned to slightly different hobbies like hiking, biking, and spikeball.
  Although one can indeed surf in Munich, I haven't yet found a true fix for 
  being in the ocean üåä So most of my non-work travels are to the coast, looking 
  for waves and enjoying the sun üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I also like to play and listen to music! 
  I've been playing the cello for 15 years and although I had to leave my 
  instrument at home in the states, I'm hoping to get one soon here in Munichüé∂ 
  In the meantime, I tide myself 
  over by messing around on the piano and guitar, and learning German üá©üá™
  If you're in the Munich 
  area and want to jam, throw a frisbee, play soccer, spikeball, or just want
  to grab a beer, hit me up!
  I'll have a gallery of fun pictures coming soon, so stay tuned! üì∏

  description: "I've been primarily an academic for 
  for almost a decade... which I actually can't believe.
  I started as an undergrad in mathematics and physics   
  at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.berkeley.edu/'>UC Berkeley</a>,
  finishing just before the pandemic
  went underway. 
  During COVID, I completed a masters in data science 
  and machine learning at 
  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.chapman.edu/'>Chapman University</a>
  while living at my childhood home
  in Orange County. Luckily, I was also was able to pick
  up some industry experience and hone my development skills,
  working first as a ML consultant at 
  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.madiba.com/'>Madiba</a>, and then part-time
  as a software and research developer for 
  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.encryptek.net/'>Encryptek</a> during my 
  Masters. These experiences helped me build 
  towards my position at CHOC as a grant-funded
  Research Scientist. During this position, I worked with my advisor
  <a target='_blank' href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xu4laD8AAAAJ&hl=en'>Louis
  Ehwerhemuepha</a> to build predictive models for early identification
  of pediatric sepsis. This applied research invited me into the world of 
  computational topology, an amazing playground straddling the worlds of
  pure mathematics and machine learning. After that I was hooked!
  Soon after, I accepted
  an offer to work with <a target='_blank' href='https://bastian.rieck.me/'>Bastian Rieck</a>,
  studying topological and geometric deep learning.
  I've also had the pleasure of working with 
  <a target='_blank' href='https://stuartwayland.github.io/'>Stuart Wayland</a> and
  <a target='_blank' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidney-gathrid/'>Sidney Gathrid</a> 
  on various projects for the last few years, eventually culminating in us 
  founding <a target='_blank' href='https://krv.ai/'>Krv</a> in 2023‚Äì for any math-inclined readers out there, our first project together (now published in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-025-01871-0>Nature Energy</a>) featured an algorithm that used discrete versions of Riemannian curvature for graphs... hence the name "Krv", short for "curvature".

      position: "<em>Nature Energy, October 23, 2025</em>"
      content: "Strategically planning the phase-out of coal power is critical to achieve climate targets, yet current approaches often fail to account for the context-specific barriers and vulnerabilities to retirement. Here we introduce a framework that combines graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the US coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on technical, economic, environmental and socio-political characteristics. We calculate each non-retiring coal plant‚Äôs ‚Äòcontextual retirement vulnerability‚Äô score, a metric developed to quantify susceptibility to retirement drivers using the graph-based distance to a coal plant with an announced early retirement. Separately, we identify ‚Äòretirement archetypes‚Äô that explain the key factors driving announced retirements within each group, which are used to inform group-specific strategies for accelerating retirements. Our findings reveal the diverse strategies that are required to accelerate the phase-out of remaining coal plants, including regulatory compliance, public health campaigns and economic incentives."

    - name: "No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets"
      position: "<em>ICML 2025</em>"
      content: "Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- the graph structure and the node features -- , we introduce RINGS, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., by quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing, from a distinct angle, the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for graph-learning dataset evaluation in an extensive set of experiments and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a first step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations."

      position: "<em>IPLDSC 2024</em>"
      content: "Identifying (a) systemic barriers to quality healthcare access and (b) key indicators of care efficacy in the United States remains a significant challenge. To improve our understanding of regional disparities in care delivery, we introduce a novel application of curvature, a geometrical-topological property of networks, to Physician Referral Networks. Our initial findings reveal that Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvature measures, which are known for their expressive power in characterizing network structure, offer promising indicators for detecting variations in healthcare efficacy while capturing a range of significant regional demographic features. We also present `apparent`, an open-source tool that leverages Ricci curvature and other network features to examine correlations between regional Physician Referral Networks structure, local census data, healthcare effectiveness, and patient outcomes."

    - name: "Mapping the Multiverse of Latent Representations"
      position: "<em>ICML 2024</em>"
      content: "Echoing recent calls to counter reliability and robustness 
      concerns in machine learning via multiverse analysis, we present PRESTO, 
      a principled framework for mapping the multiverse of machine-learning 
      models that rely on latent representations. Although such models enjoy 
      widespread adoption, the variability in their embeddings remains poorly 
      understood, resulting in unnecessary complexity and untrustworthy representations.
      Our framework uses persistent homology to characterize the latent spaces 
      arising from different combinations of diverse machine-learning methods, 
      (hyper)parameter configurations, and datasets, allowing us to measure 
      their pairwise (dis)similarity and statistically reason about their distributions.
      As we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically, our pipeline 
      preserves desirable properties of collections of latent representations, 
      and it can be leveraged to perform sensitivity analysis, 
      detect anomalous embeddings, or efficiently and effectively 
      navigate hyperparameter search spaces."

      position: "<em> NeurIPS 2023 </em>"
      content: "In response to rising interest for generative model use in 
      drug development, we introduce a new topological and geometric descriptor 
      for graph distributions based on curvature filtrations. 
      As well as favorable stability and expressivity properties, 
      our method affords scalable statistical comparisons and hypothesis 
      testing for sets of graphs, providing an exciting and well-principled 
      method for evaluating Graph Generative Models."

      structural differences between graphs. Despite these advancements, the 
      theoretical properties of discrete curvature measures, such as their
