  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
    full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
    good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
    leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.

  title: "Experience"
  description: "I'm a bit of a wanderer in the realm of knowledge and innovation. 
  Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of AI and healthcare as a 
  Doctoral Researcher at AIDOS Lab, Helmholtz Munich. 
  Under the guidance of Dr. Bastian Rieck, I'm exploring the fascinating realms 
  of topological and geometric deep learning, among other mind-bending topics.
  When I'm not in the lab, you might find me hustling as a Co-founder at Krv 
  Analytics, where we're on a mission to revolutionize analytics solutions. 
  It's been a wild ride, from strategic planning to getting our hands dirty with 
  product development â€“ every step feels like an adventure.
  But that's not all! I've also had the privilege of interning at the 
  Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Orange County, where I got a firsthand look at the 
  intersection of research and healthcare.
  Yeah, it's been quite the journey, and I'm just getting started! ðŸš€"

    - name: "Curvature Filtrations for Graph Generative Model Evaluation"
      position: "NeurIPS 2023"
      content: "In response to rising interest for generative model use in 
      drug development, we introduce a new topological and geometric descriptor 
      for graph distributions based on curvature filtrations. 
      As well as favorable stability and expressivity properties, 
      our method affords scalable statistical comparisons and hypothesis 
      testing for sets of graphs, providing an exciting and well-principled 
      method for evaluating Graph Generative Models."

      position: "ICML 2023 TAGML Workshop"
      content: "Discrete curvature has recently been used in graph machine 
      learning to improve performance, understand message-passing and assess 
      structural differences between graphs. Despite these advancements, the 
      theoretical properties of discrete curvature measures, such as their 
      representational power and their relationship to graph features is yet to
      be fully explored. This paper studies Ollivier--Ricci curvature on graphs,
      providing both a discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity, 
      i.e. the ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs.."
