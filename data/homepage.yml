  subtitle: "Researcher | Founder"
  description: "My dream is to bridge the gap between mathematics and machine
  learning, designing new and interesting data-driven methods that can be 
  used in health care and environmental science. At the moment,
  I'm in the second year of my PhD at the Technical University of Munich, 
  where I'm researching topological and geometric deep learning. 
  I'm also the co-founder of Krv Analytics, a startup focused on analytics 
  solutions where we try to leverage our tech to solve problems all over‚Äì from
  investment banks, to hospitals, to developing nations energy grids.
  I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn, and would
  love to hear from you and exchange ideas."

  title: "More about me!"
  content: "I'm born and raised in California ‚òÄÔ∏è I love to surf, ski,
  snowboard and and generally enjoy the outdoors. 
   Now that I live in Munich, I've
  transitioned to slightly different hobbies like hiking, biking, and spikeball.
  Although one can indeed surf in Munich, I haven't yet found a true fix for 
  being in the ocean üåä So most of my non-work travels are to the coast, looking 
  for waves and enjoying the sun üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I also like to play and listen to music! 
  I've been playing the cello for 15 years and although I had to leave my 
  instrument at home in the states, I'm hoping to get one soon here in Munichüé∂ 
  In the meantime, I tide myself 
  over by messing around on the piano and guitar, and learning German üá©üá™
  If you're in the Munich 
  area and want to jam, throw a frisbee, play soccer, spikeball, or just want
  to grab a beer, hit me up!
  I'll have a gallery of fun pictures coming soon, so stay tuned! üì∏

  title: "Experience"
  description: "I've been primarily an academic for 
  for almost a decade... which I actually can't believe.
  I started as an undergrad in mathematics and physics and 
  finished just in time for the pandemic. I then went on to
  do a masters in data science and machine learning a few miles
  from where I grew up. During this time I also was able to pick
  up some industry experience, working part-time for a hardware
  acceleration company and a SAP consulting firm. This, along with
  my masters help me build towards my position at CHOC as a grant-funded
  Research Scientist. During this position, I worked with my advisor
  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xu4laD8AAAAJ&hl=en'>Louis
  Ehwerhemuepha</a> to build a predictive models for early identification
  of pediatric sepsis. This experience me invited me into the world of 
  computational topology, an amazing playground straddling the worlds of
  pure mathematics and machine learning. Next thing I knew, I had accepted
  an offer to work with <a href='https://bastian.rieck.me/'>Bastian Rieck</a>
  as a PhD student in the <a href='https://aidos.group/'>AIDOS Lab</a> in 
  Munich, Germany to study topological and geometric
  deep learning. Since then, my awesome co-founders (<a href='https://stuartwayland.github.io/'>Stuart Wayland</a> and
  <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidney-gathrid/'>Sidney Gathrid</a>) and I
  have also founded <a href='https://krv-analytics.us/'>Krv Analytics</a>, thus
  beginning a new adventure into the a fun world between academia and industry.
  Stay tuned for more updates on the journey! üöÄ

  # "I'm a bit of a wanderer in the realm of knowledge and innovation. 
  # Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of AI and healthcare as a 
  # Doctoral Researcher at AIDOS Lab, Helmholtz Munich. 
  # Under the guidance of Dr. Bastian Rieck, I'm exploring the fascinating realms 
  # of topological and geometric deep learning, among other mind-bending topics.
  # When I'm not in the lab, you might find me hustling as a Co-founder at Krv 
  # Analytics, where we're on a mission to revolutionize analytics solutions. 
  # It's been a wild ride, from strategic planning to getting our hands dirty with

      content: "In response to rising interest for generative model use in 
      drug development, we introduce a new topological and geometric descriptor 
      for graph distributions based on curvature filtrations. 
      As well as favorable stability and expressivity properties, 
      our method affords scalable statistical comparisons and hypothesis 
      testing for sets of graphs, providing an exciting and well-principled 
      method for evaluating Graph Generative Models."

      learning to improve performance, understand message-passing and assess 
      structural differences between graphs. Despite these advancements, the 
      theoretical properties of discrete curvature measures, such as their 
      representational power and their relationship to graph features is yet to
      be fully explored. This paper studies Ollivier--Ricci curvature on graphs,
      providing both a discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity, 
      i.e. the ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs.."
